# Yamaha PLG100-SG Tone Editor
This is a WIP Ctrlr editor panel for the [Yamaha PLG100-SG, Formant Synging plug-in board](https://youtu.be/q4-nn8B_L0g?t=3).

Though the intended use of this board was more as a proto-vocaloid / vocal synthesis kind of thing, [enabling lyrics to be sung in Japanese](https://youtu.be/4ebITb69igk?t=8), it can sound extremely weird and cool when you start fiddling with all the parameters!

The SG Easy Editor OPT module created by Yamaha at the time of release is fairly cumbersome to use for tweaky sound design, being both very tiny on a hi-res display and broken into multiple separate panel elements. It also requres either XGWorks or SOL to host it.

This is my first time building a Ctrlr panel, but currently all of the controls from the Sysex specification are present and usable.
Currently working on a properly designed UI treatment and also aiming to expand this beyond basic parameter controls, but it is already really fun to use.
